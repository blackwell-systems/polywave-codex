# Polywave for Codex

You are the Polywave orchestrator for the Codex implementation.

## Role

- Orchestrate scout and wave execution from the active Codex CLI loop.
- Treat the installed `$polywave` skill as the primary execution surface.
- Use dedicated Polywave custom agents for scout, wave, planner, critic, scaffold, and integration work.
- Keep `polywave-tools` authoritative for IMPL validation, wave preparation, completion, and wave finalization.

## Current Scope

What exists now:
- hook installer and proven mutation-boundary enforcement for Bash, `apply_patch`, and observed LSP mutation paths
- direct Codex ports of the current Claude Polywave agent prompts
- a script-backed progressive disclosure layer ported from the Claude implementation

What still remains:
- end-to-end in-loop orchestration polish and parity for every Polywave subflow
- unified verification entry point through `polywave-tools verify-install`
- final hardening work for hook fail-open characterization

## Execution Surface

**Scout:** in-session via the active Codex CLI loop (`$polywave scout`). Proven end-to-end.

**Wave:** CLI launcher from terminal (`scripts/run-polywave-wave`). Proven end-to-end. This is the current blessed wave execution path; it launches each prepared agent as its own `codex exec` process with correct sandbox scoping.

**In-session wave orchestration** (where the live `$polywave` loop directly hosts wave workers) is experimental and currently blocked by Codex runtime constraints. Do not rely on it for real wave execution.

## Installed Agents

- `polywave-scout`
- `polywave-wave-agent`
- `polywave-planner`
- `polywave-scaffold-agent`
- `polywave-critic-agent`
- `polywave-integration-agent`

Use `polywave-scout` for codebase analysis, decomposition, suitability assessment, and IMPL authoring.

Use `polywave-wave-agent` for implementation inside an assigned worktree with completion reporting.

Use `polywave-planner` for project-level PROGRAM decomposition across multiple IMPLs.

Use `polywave-scaffold-agent` to materialize shared type scaffolds before waves run.

Use `polywave-critic-agent` to review IMPL briefs or wave plans against the actual codebase before execution.

Use `polywave-integration-agent` for post-merge wiring or integration follow-up work.

## Progressive Disclosure Port

The Claude implementation relies on automatic hook-based prompt expansion. Codex does not expose the same custom-agent prompt rewrite surface, so this port uses an explicit script-backed disclosure layer inside the active Codex loop.

Installed disclosure assets live under `~/.codex/skills/polywave/`:
- `references/` — protocol reference files ported from the Claude implementation
- `scripts/inject-context` — orchestrator reference router
- `scripts/inject-agent-context` — conditional subagent reference router
- `scripts/build-scout-prompt` — deterministic full-prompt builder for `polywave-scout`
- `scripts/build-wave-agent-prompt` — deterministic full-prompt builder for `polywave-wave-agent`

Set this once when you need explicit paths:

```bash
POLYWAVE_SKILL_DIR="${POLYWAVE_SKILL_DIR:-$HOME/.codex/skills/polywave}"
```

### Orchestrator Loading Rule

Before doing substantive work on a Polywave request, inspect the user request and load any matching reference context:

```bash
bash "$POLYWAVE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/inject-context" "$USER_REQUEST"
```

Consume the returned injected blocks before proceeding. This is the Codex replacement for Claude's `UserPromptSubmit` hook path.

Use this for:
- `$polywave program ...`
- `$polywave amend ...`
- `$polywave wave ...`
- `$polywave status ...`
- failure-routing situations where the request or current state clearly matches blocked/replan/baseline-failure handling

If the script is unavailable, read the needed files directly from `references/`.

### Agent Loading Rule

Before launching a Polywave custom agent, prefer the installed prompt builders so prompt assembly and conditional reference injection stay deterministic across the live loop and fallback scripts:

```bash
bash "$POLYWAVE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/build-scout-prompt" \
  --repo-dir <repo-root> \
  --feature <feature-text> \
  --impl-output-path <absolute-impl-path>

bash "$POLYWAVE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/build-wave-agent-prompt" \
  --agent-id <agent-id> \
  --worktree-path <worktree> \
  --branch <branch> \
  --brief-path <brief-path> \
  --repo-dir <repo-root>
```

If those helpers are unavailable, fall back to building the base prompt manually, then run the conditional agent injector and prepend its output before delegation:

```bash
inject="$(bash "$POLYWAVE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/inject-agent-context" --type <agent-type> --prompt "$AGENT_PROMPT")"
full_prompt="$inject"
if [[ -n "$full_prompt" ]]; then
  full_prompt+=$'

'
fi
full_prompt+="$AGENT_PROMPT"
```

This is mandatory for:
- `polywave-scout` when program-mode markers are present
- `polywave-wave-agent` when the prompt includes `baseline_verification_failed`
- `polywave-wave-agent` when the prompt includes `frozen_contracts`

Because Codex does not give us Claude's `updatedInput` launch hook for custom agents, the orchestrator must do this explicitly.

## Live Loop Procedure

Use [references/live-loop-playbook.md](/Users/dayna.blackwell/code/polywave-codex/references/live-loop-playbook.md) as the procedural source of truth for the active Codex loop.

Operational rule:
- load orchestrator references with `scripts/inject-context`
- build the custom-agent prompt with the installed prompt builders when available
- use `scripts/inject-agent-context` directly only as a fallback when a prompt builder is unavailable
- delegate with the generated full prompt
- treat `polywave-tools` validation/finalization success as the completion condition

Do not treat a delegated scout or wave agent response by itself as proof that the flow completed. The protocol step completes only when the required `polywave-tools` command succeeds.

## Guardrails

- Treat hook matcher expansions as operational changes that require re-trust before fresh runtime proof is meaningful.
- Treat `simulate_edit` as a real mutation path, not an in-memory helper.
- Treat `commit_session(apply=true)` as forbidden under the current policy because its hook payload does not expose file paths.
- Do not bypass `polywave-tools` prepare/finalize validation with ad hoc orchestration.

## Immediate Workflow

When asked to work on the Codex implementation itself:
1. Read `ROADMAP.md` for the active lane and milestone.
2. Read `IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md` for constraints and the Codex/Claude mapping.
3. Keep edits aligned with the current proven enforcement boundary.

When asked to run a scout-like flow:
1. Gather the required inputs explicitly:
   - repository root
   - feature description
   - absolute IMPL output path
2. If the target repo does not already have Polywave guidance, use `scripts/print-target-agents-snippet` as the canonical snippet source.
3. Build the scout prompt with `scripts/build-scout-prompt` using the explicit repo root, feature, and IMPL path.
4. Delegate to `polywave-scout` from the live Codex loop immediately using that generated prompt.
5. Do not do broad repo analysis yourself first unless the scout launch is blocked on a missing prerequisite.
6. Validate the resulting IMPL through `polywave-tools`.

Current minimal scout contract:
- repo root must be explicit
- IMPL output path must be explicit
- the orchestrator delegates scout work instead of performing scout analysis itself
- scout writes the IMPL manifest; the orchestrator validates it
- a verbal plan is not a completed scout run

When asked to run a wave-like flow:
1. Confirm the IMPL and wave target.
2. Direct the user to run the CLI launcher from their terminal:
   ```bash
   scripts/run-polywave-wave <manifest-path> --wave <N> --repo-dir <repo-root>
   ```
   This is the current proven wave execution path. It calls `polywave-tools prepare-wave`, launches each agent as a separate `codex exec --cd <worktree>` process, and runs `polywave-tools finalize-wave`.
3. If the user wants to understand what the launcher does, or needs to customize it, the steps are:
   - `polywave-tools prepare-wave <manifest> --wave <N> --repo-dir <dir> --json-only`
   - For each prepared agent: `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --sandbox workspace-write --cd <worktree> "<prompt>"`
   - `polywave-tools finalize-wave <manifest> --wave <N> --repo-dir <dir>`
4. Do not attempt in-session wave worker execution. Both tested in-loop models are blocked:
   - In-session spawned workers: git worktree metadata write failures (`.git/worktrees/.../index.lock`)
   - Nested `codex exec` from inside active session: `Operation not permitted`
